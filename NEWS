History of user-visible changes in Libvm68k.  -*-Outline-*-

* Version 1.0.6

** Interface Changes

Small changes were made to class templates basic_uint16_iterator and
basic_uint32_iterator.

* Version 1.0.5

** Interface Changes

New headers <vm68k/iterator.h> and <vm68k/size.h> were added.

Throw-specs were added to the methods of `class memory'.  This could
break binary compatibility.

* Version 1.0.4

** Interface Changes

The header <vm68k/except.h> was merged into <vm68k/processor.h> and
removed.

The typedefs uint_type and sint_type were removed.  This would break
binary compatibility.

* Version 1.0.3

** Updates for GCC 3.0

Code was modified to fix errors detected by GCC 3.0.

** Interface Changes

Part of the library interface changed.  Now the library version can be
retrieved by the function vm68k::version.  This broke binary
compatibility.

* Version 1.0.2

** Documentation Updates

A Texinfo documentation was added.

* Version 1.0.1

Libvm68k was separated from the vx68k package.  See the file NEWS.vx68k
for older changes.
