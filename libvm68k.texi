@chapter M68000 Architecture Basics

Before describing internals of Libvm68k, let's review the M68000
architecture.

Readers who is familiar with this architecture can skip this chapter.

@section Data Size

In M68000 architecture, a @dfn{byte} is 8-bit long.  A @dfn{word} is two
bytes.  A @dfn{long word} is two words, or four bytes.

@section Definitions of Basic Types.
Libvm68k defines several basic types to keep the program
portable. These types are defined in namespace
@code{vm68k::types} and imported in namespace
@code{vm68k}.

@deftp Typedef uint_type
This is a natural unsigned type that can
hold an unsigned word number on M68000. This type is
@code{unsigned int} on all host architectures.
@end deftp

@deftp Typedef uint32_type
This is a natural unsigned type that can
hold an unsigned long word number on M68000. This type is
@code{unsigned int} on host architectures that have
@code{unsigned int} with at least 32-bit.
@end deftp

@deftp Typedef sint_type
@code{sint_type} is a natural signed type that can
hold a signed word number on M68000. This type is
@code{int} on most host architectures, but if the host
architecture cannot represent -0x8000 in that type, i.e. it
does not use 2's complement representation, it is @code{long
int} instead.
@end deftp

@deftp Typedef sint32_type
@code{sint32_type} is a natural signed type that can hold a signed long
word number on M68000. This type is @code{int} on host architectures
that have @code{int} with at least 32-bit and that can represent
-0x80000000 in that type. Otherwise, it is @code{long int} if the type
can hold -0x80000000, or @code{long long int} if the compiler is GCC. If
there is no type that can hold -0x80000000 on the architecture, Libvm68k
cannot be compiled.

@node Memory Interface, Processor, Basic Types, Using Libvm68k
@section Memory Interface

@cindex memory
Memory is an object that can be mapped in an address space.
The class @code{memory} is the abstract base
class for all memory.

Libvm68k uses a single address space to access memory
and peripheral devices.

User program reference.  The processor uses this value in the user state
for reading instructions.

@section Processor
@cindex processor

A processor is made of a pair of a context and an execution
unit. A context represents the dynamic state, which is
updated by program execution. An execution unit represents
the static setting that is not changed while program
execution.
